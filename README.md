# Memory-Game
Here I have created a memory game by using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and the rules are mentioned below:
1. The Game starts by flipping any two random images.
2. If that two random images matches themselves then an alert shows that "Congratulations! You  found a pair of matching items" and the score will be incremented by one.
3. If the images are not same then an alert shows that "Sorry,You have selected different items, Please try again to find a match!".
4. And finally the continues until all the matches are not flipped.
5. You can play this game again and again by just refreshing the webpage.
